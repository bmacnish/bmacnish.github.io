I'm a career changer coming to software development after a decade working as a professional artist where spent five years collecting 22,000 used plastic bags, let audiences explore a stranger's home alone and painted a suburban house transforming it into a glossy black monolith.

I'm still fresh to coding having self-taught for a year before lucking out and getting into the apprenticeship program run by [Envato](https://envato.com/) where I now have a job learning to be a software developer.

There's nothing quite like trying to explain an idea to make sure you've grasped it yourself and that's what this blog is all about. As I learn new ideas, I'm going to share them here, in plain English with simple examples to help consolidate them in my own mind and, hopefully, in yours.
